# TO-DO LIST 📝

A simple personal exercise to discover [Vue.js (v3)](https://v3.vuejs.org/)

Single page of a simple to-do list with a local storage.

If, like me, you are learning Javascript, I advise you to avoid spending time learning Jquery, which has served you well but is now useless since the arrival of the three main JS frameworks:

- Angular,
- React,
- Vue.

Test all three on simple projects and then go deeper into the one you feel most comfortable with!

Have fun !
